1.3
---
- 8 years have passed!
- Integrated a bunch of Gerfried Fuchs' changes maintained for the debian version for years
and years
- Added him to the CREDITS, too.
- Support for devfs, and alternate console devices.
- Warnings about multiply-specified frequency
- Debug mode

1.2.2
-----
- Man pages now gzip -9 for better compression
- Table of frequencies added to man page
- Fix for platforms with unsigned chars
- On ioctl() errors, beep will now do a printf("\a") so that, at very least, youget a beep.  :)


1.2.1
-----
- fixed segfault when handling long options

1.2.0
-----
- added -n/--new support - so beep FINALLY handles multiple beeps on a single
 command line.
- -f now takes decimal frequencies, not just whole numbers.

1.0.2
-----
- Added more common -V option, as companion to -v and --version
- README now addresses the question of multiple beeps, and composing music with
  beep.

1.0.1
-----
- Fixed some outdated comments in the source, and a typo in the man page.

1.0.0
-----
- added a SIGINT handler, so Ctrl-C no longer leaves the speaker wailing 
  forever
- added -v/--version and -h/--help support
- updated man page
- this release is changed from 0.8 to 1.0.0, it's worthy of it.  Feature
  complete and no outstanding bugs that I know of.

0.6.1
-----
- changed man page to gzip format (instead of bzip2)
- updated man page and README to explain ioctl problems


0.6
---
- added -D option.  Both -d and -D set inter-repetition delay, but -D instructs
  beep to delay even after the last beep, where -d delays only between beeps, 
  and terminates immediately after last beep.
- incorporated Rick Franchuk's idea of stdin hooks - dear god -c is annoying.
- added a man page


0.5
---
- changed over from manually parsing command line parms to getopt()
- changed atoi() calls into sscanf() calls, to get more meaningful error 
  handling

0.4
---
- first usable
- initial options supported: -f, -l, -d, -r
